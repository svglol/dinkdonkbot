## Permissions Issues
When setting up DinkDonk Bot, we dont require admin permissions by default, that means that to post messages and notifications in some channels, you will need to give the bot the "Send Messages" & "Mention Everyone" permission in those channels. Likewise if you want to use any of the emote management features, you will need to give the bot the "Manage Emojis and Stickers" permission.

Any further issues can be reported to our support server [here](https://discord.gg/NuY7Tnrb6F) or you can create an issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/svglol/dinkdonkbot/issues).
