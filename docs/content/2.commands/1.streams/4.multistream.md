| Command | Description |

## Linking Kick & Twitch

Link a Twitch and Kick streamer to merge their notifications:
You must first have individual stream subscriptions set up for both the Twitch and Kick streamers before you can link them, they must also be setup to post in the same `#text-channel`. If you both Twitch and Kick account names are the same then the multistream link will be created automatically, otherwise you will need to link them manually. Refer to the [Twitch](/commands/streams/twitch) and [Kick](/commands/streams/kick) command documentation for more information.

```
/streams multistream link <twitch-streamer> <kick-streamer> [priority] [late-merge]
```

### Parameters

::field-group
::field{name="twitch-streamer" type="string" required}
The Twitch username of the streamer to link
::field{name="kick-streamer" type="string" required}
The Kick username of the streamer to link
::field{name="priority" type="twitch|kick"}
Default to `twitch` - Which platform to prioritize for stream details like title and game (`twitch` or `kick`)
::field{name="late-merge" type="boolean"}
Default to `true` - Whether to always merge notifications even if one platform is delayed
::

## Unlinking Twitch & Kick Streamers

Remove a multistream connection:
This will stop merging notifications for the linked Twitch and Kick streamers, but will not delete individual streamer subscriptions.

```
/streams multistream unlink [twitch-streamer] [kick-streamer]
```

### Parameters

::field-group
::field{name="twitch-streamer" type="string"}
The Twitch username of the streamer to unlink (required if kick-streamer is not provided)
::field{name="kick-streamer" type="string"}
The Kick username of the streamer to unlink (required if twitch-streamer is not provided)
::

## Editing Multistream Settings

Modify settings for an existing multistream connection: This allows you to change priority or late-merge timing without unlinking and relinking.

```
/streams multistream edit [twitch-streamer] [kick-streamer] [priority] [late-merge]
```

### Parameters

::field-group
::field{name="twitch-streamer" type="string"}
The Twitch username of the streamer to edit (required if kick-streamer is not provided)
::field{name="kick-streamer" type="string"}
The Kick username of the streamer to edit (required if twitch-streamer is not provided)
::field{name="priority" type="twitch|kick"}
Change which platform to prioritize for stream details like title and game
::field{name="late-merge" type="boolean"}
Change if notifications should always merge even if one platform is delayed
::

## Testing Multistream Notifications

Preview what your multistream notifications will look like:

```
/streams multistream test <twitch-streamer> <kick-streamer> [message-type] [global]
```

### Parameters

::field-group
::field{name="twitch-streamer" type="string" required}
The Twitch username in the multistream link
::field{name="kick-streamer" type="string" required}
The Kick username in the multistream link
::field{name="message-type" type="string"}
Default to `live` - Test `live` or `offline` notification
::field{name="global" type="boolean"}
Default to `false` - Display the message to everyone as if the streamer just went live (will ping people so use with caution)
::

## Priority Settings

Control which platform takes precedence when both streams are live:

- **`twitch`** - Prefer Twitch stream details such as title and game.
- **`kick`** - Prefer Kick stream details such as title and game.

## Late Merge

The late-merge setting allows you to specify if you want to always merge notifications, even if one platform is delayed longer than we wait for both platforms to go live. This is useful for streamers who consistently have one platform go live significantly later than the other. By disabling late-merge, a new notification will be sent when the streamer goes live on the second platform, even if the first platform's notification has already been sent. This ensures that you don't miss notifications for streamers who have inconsistent go-live times across platforms.
