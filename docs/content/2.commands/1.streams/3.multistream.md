## Commands Overview

All Multistream commands start with `/streams multistream`

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`link`](#linking-streamers) | Link a Twitch and Kick streamer for unified notifications |
| [`unlink`](#unlinking-streamers) | Remove a multistream connection |
| [`edit`](#editing-multistream-settings) | Edit multistream configuration |
| [`test`](#testing-multistream-notifications) | Test a multistream alert |

## Linking Streamers

Link a Twitch and Kick streamer to merge their notifications:
You must first have individual stream subscriptions set up for both the Twitch and Kick streamers before you can link them. Refer to the [Twitch](/commands/streams/twitch) and [Kick](/commands/streams/kick) command documentation for more information.

```
/streams multistream link <twitch-streamer> <kick-streamer> [priority] [late-merge]
```

### Parameters

- **twitch-streamer** (required) - The Twitch username of the streamer
- **kick-streamer** (required) - The Kick username of the streamer
- **priority** (optional) - Which platform to prioritize (`twitch`, `kick`) default: `twitch`
- **late-merge** (optional) - Whether to always merge notifications even if one platform is delayed (`true` or `false`) default: `true`

## Unlinking Streamers

Remove a multistream connection:
This will stop merging notifications for the linked Twitch and Kick streamers, but will not delete individual streamer subscriptions.

```
/streams multistream unlink [twitch-streamer] [kick-streamer]
```

### Parameters

- **twitch-streamer** (optional) - The Twitch username to unlink
- **kick-streamer** (optional) - The Kick username to unlink

## Editing Multistream Settings

Modify settings for an existing multistream connection: This allows you to change priority or late-merge timing without unlinking and relinking.

```
/streams multistream edit [twitch-streamer] [kick-streamer] [priority] [late-merge]
```

### Parameters

- **twitch-streamer** (required one of twitch-streamer or kick-streamer) - The Twitch username to edit 
- **kick-streamer** (required one of twitch-streamer or kick-streamer) - The Kick username to edit
- **priority** (optional) - Change platform priority (`twitch`, `kick`)
- **late-merge** (optional) - Change if notifications should always merge even if one platform is delayed (`true` or `false`)

## Testing Multistream Notifications

Preview what your multistream notifications will look like:

```
/streams multistream test <twitch-streamer> <kick-streamer> [message-type] [global]
```

### Parameters

- **twitch-streamer** (required) - The Twitch username in the multistream link
- **kick-streamer** (required) - The Kick username in the multistream link
- **message-type** (optional) - Test `live` or `offline` notification (default: `live`)
- **global** (optional) - Display the message to everyone as if the streamer just went live (will ping people so use with caution) (`true` or `false`)

## Priority Settings

Control which platform takes precedence when both streams are live:

- **`twitch`** - Prefer Twitch stream details such as title and game.
- **`kick`** - Prefer Kick stream details such as title and game.

## Late Merge

The late-merge setting allows you to specify if you want to always merge notifications, even if one platform is delayed longer than we wait for both platforms to go live. This is useful for streamers who consistently have one platform go live significantly later than the other. By disabling late-merge, a new notification will be sent when the streamer goes live on the second platform, even if the first platform's notification has already been sent. This ensures that you don't miss notifications for streamers who have inconsistent go-live times across platforms.
