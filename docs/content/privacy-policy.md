Your data is never:

- When you configure clip notifications, we periodically check for new clips and use your channel settings to post updates

## Data Storage and Security

We store your data securely in a database with appropriate security measures. Data is retained only as long as necessary for providing the Bot's services. If you remove the Bot from your server, your server-specific data will be automatically deleted after 30 days.

### Data Retention Periods

- **Active Data**: Data actively used for bot functionality is retained as long as you use the service
- **Command Logs**: Usage statistics are retained for up to 90 days
- **Error Logs**: Technical error information is retained for up to 14 days
- **Temporary Processing Data**: Data used for temporary operations (such as emote processing) is deleted immediately after use

## Cross-Border Data Transfers

DinkDonk Bot operates using Cloudflare Workers, which may process data in various global locations. Your data may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. By using the Bot, you consent to these international transfers. We ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data regardless of location.
